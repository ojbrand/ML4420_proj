DS 4420 Project 

Topic: Fitness 

### Problems:
Two methods:
- Times series: Fat loss/Muscle mass gain prediction, given data features input to predict 

- Collaborative filtering: Workout exercises recommendation based on user's need



### Logic: 
User ask for exercise recommendation for workout by using our collaborative filtering powered recommendation system(User can input specific body parts that they want to focus on) -> They input the recommended plan into the time series prediction model with their intention of either gaining muscle or losing fat → the time series model eventually output a number predicted lbs of muscle gained/fat loss over x days(based on user input)

### Next steps:
Git repo creation + invite Professor Eric (Owen)
Literature review for time series method(Owen)
Literature review for collaborative filtering(Junhua)
