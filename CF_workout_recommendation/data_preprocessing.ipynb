Each day will have two primary compound lifts. 5-10 lbs added each session for the squat, deadlift and clean with 2.5-5lbs added for the pressing movements. On deadlift we will use a + set to squeeze more out of our good workouts and prevent stalls. The primary lifts will be the low bar squat, deadlift (conventional please), bench press, overhead press, and the power clean. Some basic accessories are programmed as well. Add additional accessories as needed or desired. Dips, pull overs, lateral raises, skull crushers, and rowing variations all in the 8-12 rep range all recommended accessory work to be dosed as desired but not required. Pull-up/chins should use assistance or weight as needed to to hit 5-8 rep range. Program is written for 6 weeks but can be rode out until progression stops. Workouts are either A,B or C.

He’s not going on an MPA Tour—he’s going on a Meaty Phallic Armageddon Tour, and you’re coming with him, rep for rep, fart for fart.\\n\\nThis program is bursting at the seams like a pair of medium gym shorts in July. You’ll curl, you’ll extend, you’ll thrust with purpose, and by the end, your biceps will look like they’re smuggling pineapples, your triceps will resemble thankless meat batons, and your sleeves will be reduced to tight, trembling garters.\\n\\nWe’re not just training arms. We’re creating weapons of mass dysfunction.\\n\\nThe workout is split into three phases:\\n\\nThe Warm-Up Stiffener – 5 minutes of “mobility” that looks suspiciously like foreplay at a wrestling-themed bachelorette party.\\n\\nThe Vascular Anaconda Initiative – 20 minutes of biceps movements designed to put veins on your veins. By the end, your arms will look like they're choking themselves out in a hotel bathroom.\\n\\nOperation Backblast – 20 minutes of triceps torture that turns your upper arms into aggressively patriotic turkey legs. Every pressdown will feel like slamming the gates on a high-speed train of testosterone.\\n\\nThe MS-69 Detonation Protocol – a 15-minute non-stop, fart-filled superset finale where dignity dies, sleeves rip, and friendships are cemented in sweat, shame, and synchronized gastrointestinal distress.\\n\\nThis isn’t for beginners. This is for degenerates, meat wizards, brofessors of thrustology, and anyone brave enough to do Zottman curls while holding in an unreleased chili dog demon. If you’re not flexing so hard you pass out in the parking lot, you’re the problem.\\n\\nExpect:\\n\\nReps so dirty they’ll need to register as sex offenders in three states.\\n\\nCurls so intense you’ll start naming your veins.\\n\\nTriceps extensions that sound like balloon animals being made in a thunderstorm.\\n\\nThe occasional accidental protein fart that triggers gym-wide lockdown.\\n\\nDeep eye contact, deep thrusts, and deeper shame.\\n\\nThis program is best performed with:\\n\\nYour best bro (and future deportee),\\n\\nA full scoop of illegal preworkout,\\n\\nAnd zero concern for public opinion.\\n\\nThis is OPERATION: FULL THRUST™.\\nThis is Sgt.

       "      <td>This program is the culmination of years of my personal experience in working out, as well as insights gathered from fitness influencers and knowledgeable individuals in the fitness community. It’s not just a workout plan but a reflection of what has worked for me personally. Some exercises in this program are my favorites because they have delivered great results or simply felt good to perform.\\n\\nThe foundation of this program is a basic double progression method. In simple terms, you’ll work within a set and rep range, and once you hit the top of that range for all sets, you’ll increase the weight. For instance, if you have 3 sets of 5-8 reps (3x5-8), you’ll gradually add reps each week until you reach 3x8 with the current weight. After that, you’ll increase the weight and start over at the lower end of the range. It’s straightforward—so don’t overthink it!\\n\\nFor optimal recovery, rest between sets should be 90 to 150 seconds, with 2 minutes being ideal if you’re unsure.\\n\\nMethods explained:\\nCluster sets - small sets inside a regular set. These small sets are known as sub-sets. Short rests are added between every sub-set. This allows your muscles to recover, and you can train with heavier weights with less fatigue. For example 5 minutes of exercise with 10-15 seconds break between 5 reps\\n\\nSuper set - doing two exercises in a succession without rest (preferably these 2 exercises should work different muscle / be complementary groups so you can train one while resting the other one)\\n\\nSquat Method\\nUse Periodization (5-Week Blocks)\\nStructure:\\nWeek 1: Start light (e.g., 140 kg for top set of 3).\\nWeeks 2-5: Add 5-10 kg weekly (e.g., 145, 150, 155, 160 kg).\\nPeak: Week 5 is your strongest. If performance drops in weeks 6-7, your peak is week 5.\\nNext Block:\\nStart slightly heavier than the previous block (e.g., 145 kg in block 2).\\nRepeat 5-week cycles, aiming to end heavier each block.</td>\n",

Now you rise—stronger, sharper, unstoppable.”\\n\\nThis isn’t just a workout plan. It’s a transformation story.\\nYour arc. Your comeback. Your revenge.\\n\\nOver 18 brutal weeks, you’ll train like the main character of your own anime—facing weakness, failure, and doubt head-on, and crushing them under iron and discipline.\\n\\n🧠 Program Structure:\\nPhase 1: The Foundation Arc (Weeks 1–6)\\nYou build your base. Clean form, moderate volume, controlled tempo. You become a student of pain.\\n\\nPhase 2: The Ascent Arc (Weeks 7–12)\\nVolume increases. Sets get heavier. You push past what you thought were limits. You begin to move like someone different.\\n\\nPhase 3: The Final Arc (Weeks 13–18)\\nIntensity peaks. Rest times drop. You operate with surgical precision. No wasted reps. No wasted effort. Just war.\\n\\n💪 Training Breakdown:\\nFull-body training, 6 days/week\\n\\nHypertrophy focused (8–15 reps)\\n\\nRIR-based intensity tracking (from 3 to 0 over time)\\n\\nCompound + isolation balance\\n\\nPush/pull/leg/core emphasis shifts across days\\n\\nProgressive overload built-in to every phase\\n\\nEach week, you hit:\\nChest, back, arms, legs, shoulders, core—again and again, until you’re unrecognizable.\\n\\n🧬 Backed by Science:\\nFull-body training boosts muscle protein synthesis\\n\\nRIR tracking prevents burnout and increases longevity\\n\\nProgressive overload ensures consistent growth\\n\\nIsolation work adds aesthetic definition\\n\\n🔥 Mentality:\\nNo glory. No spotlight. Just silent suffering.\\nYou’re not here to impress—you're here to transform.\\n\\nBy week 18, they won’t recognize you.\\nBy week 18, you won’t recognize you.\\n\\nThis isn’t fitness.

Heavy duty training requires an adequate rest period between workouts, a minimum of 72 hours but preferably every 96 hours. Every rep will include a 4 second concentric and 4 second eccentric(this does not provide any hypertrophic benefits, it just makes the exercise SAFER). Lastly, if you are a beginner, focus your first month or two on nailing down your form. And remember you'll only get better at exerting yourself as time goes on. Training to failure will be easier as you train more and more thus giving you better workouts every time.   \n",

This is a 4 day split linear progression intended for novices new to lifting and late-novice/intermediate lifters coming off of a long layoff and looking for a bridge program. Each day will have two primary compound lifts. 5-10 lbs added each session for the squat, deadlift and clean with 2.5-5lbs added for the pressing movements. On deadlift we will use a + set to squeeze more out of our good workouts and prevent stalls. The primary lifts will be the low bar squat, deadlift (conventional please), bench press, overhead press, and the power clean. Some basic accessories are programmed as well. Add additional accessories as needed or desired. Dips, pull overs, lateral raises, skull crushers, and rowing variations all in the 8-12 rep range all recommended accessory work to be dosed as desired but not required. Pull-up/chins should use assistance or weight as needed to to hit 5-8 rep range. Program is written for 6 weeks but can be rode out until progression stops. Workouts are either A,B or C. I would try to run out the ACAB sequence out to 12 or even 16 weeks for a newer lifter (SKINNY GUYS NEED TO EAT)   \n",

       "1637  💥 OPERATION: FULL THRUST™ – The Final Pumpment of Sgt. MS-69\\nWelcome to the arm workout that violates the Geneva Convention, offends basic anatomy, and confuses border agents. This is no ordinary pump. This is Brian’s Parting Package—a 60-minute international incident designed to commemorate the “deployment” (read: deportation) of your boy Brian, a man so American he bleeds whey and farts freedom. He’s not going on an MPA Tour—he’s going on a Meaty Phallic Armageddon Tour, and you’re coming with him, rep for rep, fart for fart.\\n\\nThis program is bursting at the seams like a pair of medium gym shorts in July. You’ll curl, you’ll extend, you’ll thrust with purpose, and by the end, your biceps will look like they’re smuggling pineapples, your triceps will resemble thankless meat batons, and your sleeves will be reduced to tight, trembling garters.\\n\\nWe’re not just training arms. We’re creating weapons of mass dysfunction.\\n\\nThe workout is split into three phases:\\n\\nThe Warm-Up Stiffener – 5 minutes of “mobility” that looks suspiciously like foreplay at a wrestling-themed bachelorette party.\\n\\nThe Vascular Anaconda Initiative – 20 minutes of biceps movements designed to put veins on your veins. By the end, your arms will look like they're choking themselves out in a hotel bathroom.\\n\\nOperation Backblast – 20 minutes of triceps torture that turns your upper arms into aggressively patriotic turkey legs. Every pressdown will feel like slamming the gates on a high-speed train of testosterone.\\n\\nThe MS-69 Detonation Protocol – a 15-minute non-stop, fart-filled superset finale where dignity dies, sleeves rip, and friendships are cemented in sweat, shame, and synchronized gastrointestinal distress.\\n\\nThis isn’t for beginners. This is for degenerates, meat wizards, brofessors of thrustology, and anyone brave enough to do Zottman curls while holding in an unreleased chili dog demon.

It’s not just a workout plan but a reflection of what has worked for me personally. Some exercises in this program are my favorites because they have delivered great results or simply felt good to perform.\\n\\nThe foundation of this program is a basic double progression method. In simple terms, you’ll work within a set and rep range, and once you hit the top of that range for all sets, you’ll increase the weight. For instance, if you have 3 sets of 5-8 reps (3x5-8), you’ll gradually add reps each week until you reach 3x8 with the current weight. After that, you’ll increase the weight and start over at the lower end of the range. It’s straightforward—so don’t overthink it!\\n\\nFor optimal recovery, rest between sets should be 90 to 150 seconds, with 2 minutes being ideal if you’re unsure.\\n\\nMethods explained:\\nCluster sets - small sets inside a regular set. These small sets are known as sub-sets. Short rests are added between every sub-set. This allows your muscles to recover, and you can train with heavier weights with less fatigue. For example 5 minutes of exercise with 10-15 seconds break between 5 reps\\n\\nSuper set - doing two exercises in a succession without rest (preferably these 2 exercises should work different muscle / be complementary groups so you can train one while resting the other one)\\n\\nSquat Method\\nUse Periodization (5-Week Blocks)\\nStructure:\\nWeek 1: Start light (e.g., 140 kg for top set of 3).\\nWeeks 2-5: Add 5-10 kg weekly (e.g., 145, 150, 155, 160 kg).\\nPeak: Week 5 is your strongest. If performance drops in weeks 6-7, your peak is week 5.\\nNext Block:\\nStart slightly heavier than the previous block (e.g., 145 kg in block 2).\\nRepeat 5-week cycles, aiming to end heavier each block.   \n",

Wave loading across the block is used for all exercises. Week over week, load increases (smallest increment, 2.5 or 5 lbs), and reps decrease if RPE targets are met. Maintain load if unable to complete all sets at prescribed RPE. Deload in week 4 by reducing volume (sets) and dropping load to the minimum used in the block.

Muscle Building (Hypertrophy)\\nEach workout targets major muscle groups with 3–4 compound and isolation exercises.\\n\\nReps are in the 8–12 range, ideal for muscle growth.\\n\\nVolume and frequency are balanced to stimulate muscle fibers effectively without overtraining.\\n\\n2. Strength Gains\\nBig lifts like bench press, squats, deadlifts, and overhead press train multiple muscles and nervous system efficiency.\\n\\nLow to moderate rep ranges (6–10) on these compound movements help increase your base strength.\\n\\n3. Balanced Physique\\nSplit ensures all muscle groups are hit evenly:\\n\\nPush day: Chest, shoulders, triceps\\n\\nPull day: Back, biceps\\n\\nLegs day: Quads, hamstrings, calves\\n\\nCore day: Abdominals and core stability\\n\\nThis avoids imbalances and helps with posture, aesthetics, and injury prevention.\\n\\n4. Recovery-Friendly\\n4 days/week with rest days in between lets muscles recover and grow.\\n\\nSmart scheduling (Push–Pull–Rest–Legs–Core–Rest–Rest) promotes recovery while keeping intensity high.\\n\\n5. Foundation for Progression\\nSuitable for progressive overload—gradually increasing weight, reps, or sets over time.\\n\\nAdaptable for different goals: lean bulking, cutting, or body recomposition.   \n",

Rest days are after squat and deadlift days.\\n\\n1 - Shoulders &amp; Triceps\\n2 - Back\\n3 - Quads &amp; Calves\\nRest\\n4 - Chest &amp; Biceps\\n5 - Posterior Chain\\nRest\\n\\nFit in Abs, extra calves &amp; Cardio wherever you like.\\n\\nAt some point in a lifter's career, typically after the novice or early intermediate phase, the most reliable way to get stronger is to become more muscular, i.e. build muscle mass. To that end, the term \"powerbuilding\" has emerged to describe a hybrid approach of training the main barbell lifts (like a powerlifter) alongside a selection of supplemental lifts done for higher reps aimed at increasing muscular size (like a bodybuilder). \\n\\nWhile some people knock powerbuilding as merely a clever marketing term, a suboptimal way to train, the fact is that many of the strongest powerlifters of all time have trained with this approach: Ed Coan, Dan Green, Kirk Karwoski, and many others..  This uses gradually decreasing reps like 8/5/2  or 5/4/3 or 6/4/2, whatever you prefer for progressing the main lifts in the context of a five-day body part split.

       "2  Based off of Andy Baker's KCS (Kingwood Strength & Conditioning) Powerbuilding program.\\n\\nIt focuses on increasing strength on one lift per day, including squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, and pull-up. Rest days are after squat and deadlift days.\\n\\n1 - Shoulders & Triceps\\n2 - Back\\n3 - Quads & Calves\\nRest\\n4 - Chest & Biceps\\n5 - Posterior Chain\\nRest\\n\\nFit in Abs, extra calves & Cardio wherever you like.\\n\\nAt some point in a lifter's career, typically after the novice or early intermediate phase, the most reliable way to get stronger is to become more muscular, i.e. build muscle mass. To that end, the term \"powerbuilding\" has emerged to describe a hybrid approach of training the main barbell lifts (like a powerlifter) alongside a selection of supplemental lifts done for higher reps aimed at increasing muscular size (like a bodybuilder). \\n\\nWhile some people knock powerbuilding as merely a clever marketing term, a suboptimal way to train, the fact is that many of the strongest powerlifters of all time have trained with this approach: Ed Coan, Dan Green, Kirk Karwoski, and many others..  This uses gradually decreasing reps like 8/5/2  or 5/4/3 or 6/4/2, whatever you prefer for progressing the main lifts in the context of a five-day body part split.  Repeat the 3 week cycle and increase your weight by at least 5 or 10 pounds.   \n",
